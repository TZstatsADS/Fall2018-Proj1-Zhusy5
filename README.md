+ This project is conducted by Siyu Zhu

+ Project summary: 

	+ This project is inspired by the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) theory, I want to explore the reasons and distributions of people's happiness, WHAT makes people happy.

	+ I dig into the purchase tendency (PT), and measure the purchase tendency using the frequency of purchase conduction appeared in the happydb. By comparing the purchase tendency between different cluters of users, it s interesting that the PT factor differ significantly in different gender and marital groups.

	+ Then, I want to illustrate how marriage influenece people's happiness. Here, I try to use happy moments text features to classify users. And a logistic regression model is fitted and tested here.

	+ Then final output is `/output/HappyDB\_analysis.html`. And all the source code and Rmd is in the `/doc/HappyDB\_analysis.Rmd`.
